<P CLASS="note"><B>Rules For Moving Cards</B></P>

<UL>

    <li>Face-down cards cannot be moved.</li>
    
    <LI>Any face up card can be built down in suit on any other face up card, not just the bottom card, no matter where in the pile it is; even a card buried in a pile can be played and all the cards below it will move with it as a unit. Nothing can be built on an ace.</LI>

    <LI>When a row stack is open (no cards in the row), you can move a king (along with any cards that might be in its stack) to the open row stack.</LI>
    
    <li>Only kings can be moved onto an empty stack.</li>
    
    <li>If a move exposes a face-down card, that card is turned face-up.</li>
