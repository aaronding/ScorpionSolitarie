This is a Solitaire game I created in 2006 using Java Swing, brought up to date in 2026.

**Play it in your browser: https://aaronding.github.io/ScorpionSolitaire/** (the `web/` folder), or run the desktop version below.

Download `Scorpion.jar` from the [latest release](https://github.com/aaronding/ScorpionSolitaire/releases/latest) and run it with Java 11 or newer:

```sh
java -jar Scorpion.jar
```

Every deal can be won: the game shuffles until its solver finds a way. Three levels (build down in any suit, the same color, or the same suit), each with its own undo rules. Give up and the computer finishes the game for you.

To build it from source (downloads two small libraries into `lib/` the first time):

```sh
./build.sh
```

To run the tests (needs Java 17 or newer):

```sh
./test.sh
```

The web version (needs Node 22):

```sh
cd web && npm install && npm run dev
```

It shares the card art and save-file format with the desktop game, and its tests replay the same rules recording, so both play by identical rules and a game number deals the same cards in either.
